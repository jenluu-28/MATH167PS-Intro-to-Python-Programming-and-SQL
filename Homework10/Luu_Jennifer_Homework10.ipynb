    "It is necessary to use different variables types to efficiently and appropriately allocate enough storage for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense for staff ID to be tinyint unsigned (0 to 255) because it is reasonable for a chain of DVD rental stores to have hundreds of employees. The unsigned specification signals that the values can only be positive because positive integers are normally used as ID numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, customer ID is appropriately smallint unsigned (0 to 65,535) because there can be  tens of thousands of customers who use this chain of DVD rental stores. Unsigned indicates positive values, which makes sense in this context because ID identifies are typically positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, rental ID is reasonably int (−2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) because each customer can have multiple rentals. There can be tens of thousands of customers across the stores, which implies that the number of rentals will scale in regards to the number of customers. Therefore, it is realistic to expect millions of transactions denoted each as a rental ID. However, rental ID is not specified to be unsigned because it is auto-increment. The default for auto-increment is signed, which includes both positive and negative numbers.\n",
